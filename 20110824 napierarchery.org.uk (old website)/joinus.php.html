<h3>Generally...</h3>

<p>All current Napier University students are welcome to join NUAC. Most of our 
  new members are complete beginners and we provide equipment and also tuition. 
  Archers with previous experience are also very welcome. You can join the Club 
  at any time of the year and you don't need to attend every session. However 
  for best results, we recommend that you start early on in the academic year 
  and attend as many practice sessions as you can.</p>
<h3>Mailing list</h3>

<p>If you haven't done so yet, please subscribe to our mailing list by sending 
  an email to napierarchery@googlemail.com. You don't need to do this if you signed 
  up at the Freshers Fair.</p>
<!--
<p>During the summer we only train outdoors, mostly in Craiglockhart Campus on 
  the Graduation Field and also at Heriot-Watt University. Our sessions can depend 
  on weather conditions, see the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/uk/dg/edinburgh_forecast_weather.html" 
  target="_new">weather forecast</a> and we do not hold regular sessions at the 
  moment.</p> 
<p>Please note that the Sighthill Sports Centre was closed in February and will 
  not reopen until <a href="http://www.napier.ac.uk/aboutus/estatestrategy/sighthill/Pages/settingoursights.aspx" target="_new">planned refurbishment</a> ends in 2010.</P>

<p>We train a couple of days in a week, depending on the weather. All welcome at any stage of the year - just drop us an email to arrange a meeting! </p>

<p>Our venue for the indoor season (well from now until Christmas anyway) is at 
  Meadowbank Stadium, located on London Road. See <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&q=Meadowbank+Stadium&fb=1&gl=uk&hq=Meadowbank+Stadium&view=map&cid=5528823726134404296&ved=0CH0QpQY&ei=RBCzTNyXOp3PjAeCuNmqDg&hnear=&z=15&iwloc=A" target="_blank">Google 
  Maps</a>, LRT buses 4, 5, 15/15A, 26, 44/44A.</p>
<p>Indoor practice times are as follows:</p>
<UL>
  <li>Mondays 20:30-22:00</li>
  <li>Fridays 18:00-22:00</li>
  </UL>
<p>During the outdoor season (March/April to September) we shoot at Craiglockhart 
  Campus, on the field between the campus building and Colinton Road. Practice 
  times as advertised. </p>
<!--
<h3>How to get there?</h3>
<img src ="/images/bus.jpg" alt ="a bus"> 
<P>To get to Craiglockhart Campus you can get either any of the following Lothian 
  Buses: 3A, 3, 18, 20, 25, 32, 34 or a 35. The exact pick up points for these buses 
  can be found on the <a href="http://www.lothianbuses.com">Lothian Buses</a> website. 
<P>

<h3>How much?</h3>
<img src="images/goldbars.jpg" alt ="gold bars">

<p>Session Membership. Attending your first three practice sessions of the academic 
  year costs £1 a time. From the fourth session onwards it costs £2 a time. If 
  you pay annual membership then these fees no longer apply.</p>

<p>Annual Membership. Joining the club costs £10 for the year, but you must also 
  join Napier Students Association. This costs an additional £15(?), which you 
  can pay either through the club or at NSA HQ directly. Annual membership for 
  the year covers the use of club's equipment and affiliation to the national 
  governing bodies, which helps with the insurance. Cash is acceptable, naturally, 
  or cheques made payable to "NSA Club Accounts - Archery".</p>
<!--
<p>Buying a club polo shirt is optional but highly encouraged and costs £18.</p>
