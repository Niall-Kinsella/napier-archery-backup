<h3>Jerome's Warm Up</h3>
<p>Meet Jerome, our resident Mr Motivator. Before each session Jerome performs a warm up, but sometimes he gets carried away! This video was filmed on the 26th November 2005 at Edinburgh University Sports Centre, be warned, there's a sweary word!</p>

<p>You have been warned!</p>

<br>

<h3>Craig's Dancing</h3>
<p>Jerome's warm up is a hard act to follow, but as craig demonstrates, a slow start followed by an increase in pace is usually the way forward. Blame the beer. At least I hope it was the beer...</p>

<a href="/movies/craig_speed.wmv">The Sprint</a>
<p>Sound is always useful in this one, otherwise you can't truly appreciate the beats. Honest.</p>

<br>

<h3>The Cheerleaders</h3>
<p>Jerome must have been so in awe of Craig's prowess that he set up his very own cheerleading corps, fronted by himself and Delphine</p>

<p>1 pence prize to the first person who translates for us!</p>

<h3>Presenting "Dangerous Jerome"</h3>
<p>Not content with merely performing five press ups, Jerome decides to tackle the infamous "Chair of Death" - Jerome knows no fear as he defies wedgies aplenty to keep you on the edge of your seat... literally</p>
